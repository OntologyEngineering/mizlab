		  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="ParagraphBody" --><p>Recently much attention has been paid to the notion of &quot;ontology&quot; in the expectation 

  that it can serve as the new, strong foundation of knowledge engineering. In 

  the conventional approach to theory of knowledge, to give the operational semantics 

  of knowledge representation has been regarded as of major importance and the 

  analysis of contents of knowledge has been considered to be subordinate to it. 

  To solidify the foundation of knowledge engineering, however, the many researchers 

  , especially in the field of knowledge sharing and reuse, has strongly felt 

  necessity of the change of such a way of thinking. The key to the problem is 

  to understand the essential interaction between &quot;form&quot; and &quot;contents&quot; on equal 

  importance. This implies that deep understanding of &quot;content&quot; will give us new 

  insight into design of knowledge representation. The notion of &quot;ontology&quot; can 

  be key to this issue.</p><p>The ultimate goal of research on ontology is to give the full picture of theory 

  of knowledge. To make improvements in the study of this difficult issue, of 

  course, it is important to accumulate huge amount of &quot;contents&quot;, and develop 

  sophisticated ontology representation language as fundamental &quot;form&quot; of knowledge.</p><p>The same thing applies to the field of intelligent educational systems (IES). 

  Building an IES requires a lot of work. At the present situation, however, it 

  is always built from scratch. Little functional components are reusable and 

  we cannot compare or assess the existing systems. Only existing contribution 

  to the solution of the problem can be found in study of the authoring tools 

  for educational systems. However, it is considered questionable whether substantial 

  benefit for the authors engaged in the complex task may be expected or not, 

  since most of existing authoring tools do not satisfy the requirements for the 

  authoring tools as shown below.</p><ul>

<li>To provide human-friendly primitives in terms of which authors can easily 

    describe define their own skeleton of IES.</li>

<li>To give appropriate guidance to authors based on the established principle 

    of the educational task by checking the rationality of the skeleton of IES.</li>

<li>To show the dynamic behavior of the IES in conceptual level by which the 

    authors can examine its validity.</li>

</ul><p>We think the key to the solution of the problem is intelligent support based 

  on &quot;task ontology&quot; which serves as a theory of vocabulary/concepts used as building 

  blocks for knowledge-based systems. The issues here also include how to represent 

  what we know about the fundamental characteristics of an IES as &quot;task ontology&quot; 

  and how to integrate it into intelligent authoring tools. Our solution is integration 

  of an ontology construction environment CLEPE as a part of the authoring tool 

  we have developed. CLEPE provides us with all the functions needed to satisfy 

  the requirements shown above.</p><p>The most important role of CLEPE is to lay the theoretical foundation for IES 

  development process. It maintains continuity from author's conceptual understanding 

  of educational task to the computational semantics of IESs. It provides human 

  friendly vocabulary for authors to describe the educational task. For the authoring 

  tools, on the other hand, it specifies the computational semantics of vocabulary 

  and also provides a set of components represented in terms of both conceptual 

  primitives and object-oriented code fragments.</p><p>The goals of our research on task ontology are to exemplify the benefits of 

  task ontology through the development of an ontology based authoring tool for 

  Computer Based Training (CBT) systems. In this paper, we will discuss the basic 

  issues on the concept of task ontology and then describe the design principle 

  of an ontology-based authoring tool for Computer Based Training (CBT) systems.</p><p>Major publications</p><ol>

		  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="ParagraphBody" --><p>SmartTrainer is a Computer Based Training System including a set of simulators 

  in the area of Electric Power System. The target task of SmartTrainer is mainly 

  to recover the accidents of substations in the electric power system. When an 

  accident happens, the electric power transmission will be interrupted, and the 

  operators should recover it as quickly as possible. The operators should find 

  the spot of the accident, continue to supply the electric power to some special 

  places such as hospital, police station at once by borrowing some power from 

  the other substations, find the causes of the accident and recover it within 

  the limited time.</p><p>The goal of the training oriented by SmartTrainer is to improve capability 

  of not only skill-based or rule-based reasoning but also knowledge-based reasoning. 

  The set of the scenarios incorporated into SmartTrainer has been designed by 

  the experienced trainers.In order to let the trainee master the principled knowledge, 

  SmartTrainer let them do practice first and then teach them the first principle 

  behind it adaptively to their mistakes, and finally, check their learning result 

  by practice(training) again. With the cycle of practice-&gt;knowledge-&gt;practice, 

  teaching process is going forward. This is a form of &quot;learning by doing&quot;.</p><p>Here we want to emphasize that the training we give to the trainee has the 

  time-limitation just like in real accidents. Multi-media technique has been 

  widely used in SmartTrainer to attain high fidelity, including the sound processor 

  to create mock buzzer when an accident happens, the movie display to show the 

  accident scene when the repairing man needs, the picture processor to create 

  the static graphics of the various equipment, and so on.</p><p>SmartTrainer is composed of five parts, those are human interface, authoring, 

  training model based on the training ontology, teaching materials model based 

  on the teaching materials ontology and simulator. Here we will discuss the designing 

  of authoring environment based on task ontology in SmartTrainer mainly</p><p>Major publications</p><ol>

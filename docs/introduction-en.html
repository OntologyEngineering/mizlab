  will increase more and more in the next century. In the real world, tiny computers 

  of the higher performance have been used by ordinary people in their homes where 

  they also enjoy access to vast amount of information sources scattered all over 

  the world thanks to the internet. In academic society, on the other hand, the 

  research on artificial intelligence is changing from building stand-alone machines 

  which try to solve problems by itself to building intelligent partners which 

  augment human capability of problem solving. This division has been run under 

  the philosophy that it contributes not only to the promotion of knowledge science 

  but also to prosperity of the real world by the feedback of the research results 

  to it in the information era. The major topic here is to investigate <b>Ontological 

  Engineering</b>(<a href="http://www.ei.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/pub/miz/miz-onteng.pdf">Article1</a>

<a href="http://www.ei.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/english/step-onteng.html">Article2</a>) 

  to establish basic theories and technologies for the next-generation knowledge 

  science. The current research projects include: methodology for ontology design 

  and its representation language, ontology-based next-generation knowledge systems, 

  knowledge sharing and reuse, and intelligent educational systems. </p><p>The<a href="http://www.ei.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/english/mizlab2.html"> research 

    map</a> depicts an overview of Mizoguchi lab's research topics on the basis 

    of ontology theory and technology. The basic theories we are developing include 

    semantics of semantic links, functions of an ontology as a meta-model, theories 

    of identity and Part/whole, and the basic technology includes task ontology 

    representation language, methodology of task/domain ontology design as well 

    as its development environment. Ontologies of time, causality, function, behavior, 

    fault, and design tasks are designed as a set of essential building blocks 

    for knowledge systems believing that the next-generation knowledge systems 

    should be built based on well-designed ontology. Intelligent design support 

    systems with functional understanding capability, advanced diagnostic systems 

    and intelligent tutoring/training systems(ITSs) are developed. An ontology-based 

    authoring tool for ITSs is also designed with a tight collaboration with industry. 

    A sophisticated negotiation theory for opportunistic group formation in CSCL(Computer 

    Supported Collaborative Learning) is developed as well as a negotiation ontology 

    which contributes to modeling of collaboration.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->

		  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="ParagraphBody" --><p>In AI research history, we can identify two types of research. One 

  is &quot;Form-oriented research&quot; and the other is &quot;Content-oriented research&quot;. The 

  former deals with logic, knowledge representation, etc. and the latter content 

  of knowledge which is critical to modelling in general. Apparently, the former 

  has dominated AI research to date, which does not allow us to say we have successfully 

  conducted AI research and contributed a lot to the real world. Recently, however, 

  &quot;Content-oriented research&quot; has become to gather more attention because a lot 

  of real-world problems to solve such as knowledge reuse, facilitation of agent 

  communication, media integration through understanding, large-scale knowledge 

  bases, etc. require not only advanced formal theories or reasoning methods but 

	  also sophisticated treatment of the content of knowledge. </p><p>Unfortunately, however, the content-oriented research is not well-established 

    enough to respond to the expectations or to become a branch of a computer 

    science due to the following shortcomings:</p><ol>

<li>It tends to be ad-hoc,</li>

<li>It does not have a methodology which enables the research results to accumulate, 

      and</li>

<li>It lacks firm basic theories and fundamental technologies.</li>

</ol><p>Ontological engineering is what we need to resolve all of these. It eventually 

    provides a basis of building models of all things which computer science is 

    interested in. Ontological engineering gives us sophisticated theories and 

    technologies for explication and utilization of design rationale of a knowledge 

    base, kernel <a href="../lectures/conceptualization/index.htm">conceptualization</a> 

    of the world of interest, strict definitions of agreed meanings of basic concepts, 

    etc. to enable &quot;accumulation of knowledge&quot; which is indispensable for efficiently 

    modelling the real world.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->

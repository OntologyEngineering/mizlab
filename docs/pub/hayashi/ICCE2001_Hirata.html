<p><b>Abstract:</b> While there are various advancement of education system development, 
  an issue namely Interoperability occurs particularly in Human Resource Development, 
  which is the largest obstruction factor for utilizing information technology 
  in HRD. In order to resolve such obstruction factor, we thought that the perspective 
  on the whole education system in designing would be needed rather than one on 
  each piece of the system. Therefore, we modeled a total education system, on 
  which various systems and persons are concerned to exchange data and reach a 
  mutual consensus. Furthermore, in developing a HRD design support system from 
  the standpoint of total design, we set each ontology related to HRD as foundational 
  technologies, that is, &quot;Competency&quot;, &quot;Benefit of Learning Contents&quot; 
  and &quot;HRD Needs&quot;. Through such experiments, we made the design process 
  and activities explicit, which were depended on judgment call and tacit knowledge 
  conventionally, and made some linkage possible on shared understanding. Until 
  now, HRD design was not able to be absolutely covered by human processing ability 
  and was not stable enough to assure its quality. Then we showed the framework 
  for HRD design. To be concrete, only formative information has been used to 
  reach a mutual consensus in the HRD design process among participants, but these 
  ontologies we developed will move their attention to understanding of content 
  of a educational plan and to lead a rational design and mutual consensus.</p>

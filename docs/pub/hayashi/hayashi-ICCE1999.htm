<p><b>Abstract: </b>This paper discusses ontology-aware authoring tool for training 
  systems. This tool uses the ontology as the source of its intelligence. The 
  ontology plays the role of a meta-model which helps authors to construct a model. 
  The major advantages of such an authoring tool are: (1) Providing human-friendly 
  primitives (descriptiveness, readability). (2) Providing multiple-views of the 
  single model of training. (3) Simulat-ing the abstract behavior of the model 
  (conceptual level operationality). (4) Verifying the consistency of models. 
  In this paper we discuss the roles of ontology in authoring tools focusing on 
  (1), (2) and (3). In addition we exemplify the benefits of ontology by giving 
  an overview of the authoring tool SmartTrainer/AT.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> It is relatively more difficult to support designing learning 
  contents than designing physical object.<br>
  The major problem is that we don't have a framework to describe the abstract 
  design object appropriately.<br>
  To solve the problem, we define an ontology for learning contents design and 
  have designed and developed a design support environment: <i>i</i>Designer based 
  on it.<br>
  Laying the ontology as a basis for functionalities of {\itshape i}Designer, 
  following two functionalities are implimented.<br>
  1) Providing designers with an environment , to facilitate designer's externalizing 
  design issues that tend to be implicit.<br>
  2) Simulating change of understanding status of supposed learners to provide 
  designers with information to verify the leanring content.</p>

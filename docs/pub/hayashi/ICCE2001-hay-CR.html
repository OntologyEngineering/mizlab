<p><b>Abstract:</b> It is important for running an organization to support learning 
  for knowledge acquisition and creation and to encourage spread and inheritance 
  of new knowledge on the proper understanding of relations between individuals 
  and organizations. This paper presents ontology-based framework of information 
  systems for knowledge management focused on a learning system in organization. 
  Major characteristics of this framework are derived from &quot;Ontology&quot; 
  which is used as an index of knowledge and &quot;Dual loop model&quot; which 
  represents the flow of knowledge in an organization. Since these two things 
  enable the framework to grasp the meaning of knowledge and the progress of organizational 
  learning, it can provides appropriate support for knowledge management Then 
  we will introduce two systems as concrete exam-ples, namely a knowledge management 
  support environment: Kfarm and a learning contents design envi-ronment: iDesigner.</p>

<P><B>Abstract</B>: To meet the needs for large-scale, high-quality
learning contents, needless to say, we have to sharpen authoring
tools. Authoring process can be roughly divided into two phases, a
composing phase and a verification phase. A great deal of effort has
been made on the support in the former phase. What seems to be
lacking, however, is that in the latter. An ontology-aware authoring
tool we have been developing has a function called ÒConceptual level
simulation. Ó This supports authors in the latter phase by showing
the behavior of learning contents not only as a sequence of concrete
behavior but also as structured and abstract behavior along the
design intention. Ontology lays the foundation for the function by
explicating operational and conceptual semantics of a training
scenario.</P>

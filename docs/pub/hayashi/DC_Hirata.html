<p><b>Abstract:</b> Activity for standardization about educational information 
  is prosperous internationally. The LOM standard is meta-data about learning 
  objects. Learning objects are every types of teaching materials, learning materials, 
  lecturers and organizations etc. LOM is important not only to spread E-learning, 
  also to realize the effectiveness of information technology for education, training 
  and learning. Primarily we looked back on the scope and the purpose of the LOM 
  standard. Then we described the meaning of LOM clearly on HRD from two sides; 
  contents oriented study and design support. Finally we introduced the LOM authoring 
  tool that we had developed. This tool can support to describe contents of learning 
  objects by LOM with vocabulary related to HRD eeds. These LOM are a basic technology 
  in order to provide appropriate learning objects which meet with needs for various 
  participants on HRD.<br>

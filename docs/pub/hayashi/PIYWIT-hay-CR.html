<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper presents ontology-based framework of information 
  systems for knowledge management focused on a learning system in organization. 
  Major characteristics of this framework are derived from &quot;Ontology&quot; 
  which is used as an index of knowledge and &quot;Dual loop model&quot; which 
  represents the flow of knowledge in an organization. Since these two things 
  make the framework possible to grasp the meaning of knowledge and the progress 
  of organizational learning, it can provides appropriate support for knowledge 
  management Then we will introduce a knowledge management support environment: 
  Kfarm as an implementation of our idea.</p>

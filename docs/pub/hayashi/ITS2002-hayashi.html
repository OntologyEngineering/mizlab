<p><b>Abstract:</b> The word of &quot;learning&quot;, in a wide sense, is used 
  as a part of the social system of education and it has been attracting researchers' 
  interest in our research area of educational systems. The goal of this research 
  is to support creation and inheritance of organizational intellect, that is, 
  &quot;learning&quot; in an organization. In this paper, we will propose an &quot;Intellectual 
  Genealogy Graph,&quot; which is a model representing chronological correlation 
  among persons, activities, and intellect in an organization. The intellectual 
  genealogy graph is a basis of intelligent functions which is useful for surveying 
  current learning conditions and clarifying the intellectual role of individuals, 
  organizations, and documents in the organization.</p>

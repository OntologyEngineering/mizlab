<p><b>Abstract:</b> While there are various advancement of education system development, 
  an issue namely Interoperability occurs particularly on Human Resource Development, 
  which is the largest obstruction factor for utilizing information technology 
  on HRD. In order to resolve such obstruction factors, we thought that the perspective 
  on the whole education system would be needed rather than one on each piece 
  of the system in designing. Therefore, we modeled a total education system where 
  various systems and persons are concerned to exchange data or reach mutual consensus. 
  Furthermore, in developing HRD design support system from the standpoint of 
  a total design, we set each ontology related to HRD, that is, &quot;Competency&quot;, 
  &quot;Benefit of Learning Contents&quot; and &quot;HRD Needs&quot;. Through 
  such experiments, we made the design process and activities explicit, which 
  were depended on judgment call and tacit knowledge conventionally, and made 
  some linkage possible on shared understanding. Then we showed a framework for 
  HRD design that was unable to be covered by human processing ability absolutely 
  and unstable in its quality to improve its quality assurance. To be concrete, 
  only formative information has been used to reach mutual consensus in the HRD 
  design process among the participants but the ontology moves their attention 
  to understanding of the content of HRD plan to lead the rational mutual consensus 
  and design.</p>

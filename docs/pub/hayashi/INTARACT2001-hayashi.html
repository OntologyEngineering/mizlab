<p><b>Title:</b> Conceptual Level Design Environment for Learning Contents<br>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> To meet the needs for large-scale, high-quality learning contents, 
  needless to say, we have to sharpen authoring tools. Authoring process can be 
  roughly divided into two phases, a composing phase and a verification phase. 
  A great deal of effort has been made on the support in the former phase. What 
  seems to be lacking, however, is that in the latter. An ontology-aware authoring 
  tool we have been developing has a function called &quot;Conceptual level simulation. 
  &quot; This supports authors in the latter phase by showing the behavior of 
  learning contents not only as a sequence of concrete behavior but also as structured 
  and abstract behavior along the design intention. Ontology lays the foundation 
  for the function by explicating operational and conceptual semantics of a training 
  scenario.</p>

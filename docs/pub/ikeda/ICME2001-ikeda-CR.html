<p><b>Abstract:</b> It is necessary that the relations between individuals and 
  organizations be properly understood and support learning for knowledge inheritance, 
  and encourage the creation, the spreading and inheriting of new knowledge. This 
  paper presents an framework of information systems for knowledge management 
  focused on a learning system in organization. Major characteristics of this 
  framework are derived from &quot;Dual loop model&quot; which represents the 
  flow of knowledge in an organization. Since these two things enable the framework 
  to grasp the meaning of knowledge and the progress of organizational learning, 
  it can provides appropriate support for knowledge management Then we will introduce 
  two systems as concrete examples, namely a knowledge management support environment:

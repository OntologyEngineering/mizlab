<p><b>Abstract</b>: Because the lifetime employment system is disappearing in 
  Japan, gknowledge transferh is becoming a more significant issue in industry. 
  Knowledge-based systems will support the knowledge transference among workers 
  via knowledge base. A job support system and an employee training system are 
  the core of knowledge transfer. It is important to build a knowledge base that 
  can be reused. Ontology makes a basis for it. We are building a knowledge management 
  system for the electric power industry. The philosophy of building the system 
  and examples of the system are introduced.</p>

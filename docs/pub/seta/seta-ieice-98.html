<P><B>Abstract:</B> Task ontology is a systematic definition of the
concepts of problem solving and it can be acceptable for both humans
and computers. In this paper, we show the availability of the problem
solving ontology through the topics on conceptual level programming
environment, called CLEPE, which is built by putting problem solving
ontology on the basis of the system. In CLEPE, (a) end-users can
easily describe their own problem solving knowledge and (b) system
can interpret the description and execute it at the conceptual
level.</P>

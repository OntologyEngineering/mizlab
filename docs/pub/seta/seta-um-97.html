<P><B>Abstract:</B> To realize a human friendly conceptual level
programming environment, it is very important to build a static user
model based on the analysis, that is, what concept are most important
for end-users when performing the task and which concepts of problem
solving specification could be out of his/her consciousness. We have
investigated a task ontology for building the static user model. By
putting task ontology on the basis of Conceptual LEvel Programming
Environment, CLEPE, it provides three major advantages as follows.
(A) It provides human-friendly primitives in terms of which users can
easily describe their own problem solving process (descriptiveness,
readability). (B) The systems with task ontology can simulate the
problem solving process at an abstract level in terms of conceptual
level primitives (conceptual level operationality). (C) It provides
ontology author with an environment for building task ontology so
that he/she can build a consistent and useful ontology.</P>

<P>In this paper, firstly we briefly introduce the concept of task
ontology. Secondly, CLEPE and its design principle is described. In
CLEPE, one can represent his/her own problem solving knowledge and
realize the conceptual-level execution.</P>

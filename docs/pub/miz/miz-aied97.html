<P>A lot of research on AI-ED has been done to date. Although we have
many theories and implemented systems some of which are used in
practice, we still need promising directions to which effort should
be devoted in order to enable further progress of AI-ED research.
</P>

<P>This paper discusses long-term perspectives of AI-ED research
aiming at giving a clear view of what we need for further promoting
the research and for enjoying the bright prosperity of AI-ED
community. The main topic here is how to engineer knowledge in IESs.
To do this, we analyze intelligent systems and show one of the
essential properties common to existing intelligent systems is
"Declarative representation of what the system knows". On the basis
of this observation, we discuss the importance of ontology
engineering which is a innovative research area in artificial
intelligence. Ontology plays several roles critical to overcoming the
drawbacks which the current IESs have. (1) It makes systems smart and
reflexive. (2) It explicates the conceptualization on which the
system is based. (3) It contributes to standardization of vocabulary.
(4) It enables them to be literate and hence to communicate with
humans. (5) It makes knowledge reusable, and so forth. In this paper,
we discuss how ontology contributes to IES research in general and
exemplify how it makes authoring systems smarter.</P>

The main aim of this research is to establich a sophisticated
methodology for building expert systems based on shared and reusable
large knowledge bases. MULTIS, one of the major components of the
methodology, performs task analysis interview and synthesizes problem
solving engines for a given task. To design MULTIS, the authors
identify libraries of task ontology and reusable software artifacts
for construction of knoweldge-based systems and make them available
for synthesis via direct-interactive mapping to task models. This
library consists of a set of highly generalized software primitives
abstracted from existing knowedge-based systems. The mapping to the
target task model is accomplished through an intermediate step in
which task performers identify the correspondence of the functional
task primitives in the form of generic vocabulary, i.e., a vocabulary
that is dependent on the task, but not on the domain of expertise. The
vocabulary combines into verb/noun phrase forming generic processes
which are generalized conceptual primitives for a given task. In this
paper, one such library of software artifacts is presented for the
task of shceduling along with the corresponding generic vocabulary and
generic process library.

A nonmonotonic student modeling system THEMIS based on logic
programming paradigm is described. A student model description
language named SMDL which takes four truth values is designed to
capture the student behavior. By asking questions when necessary,
THEMIS builds a student model as an SMDL program which explains the
behaviors of the student. It is designed on the basis of close
analysis of inconsistencies which are classified into four categories
according to the causes of them. Further, we identified they are
grouped into two groups: one should be resolved and the other should
be modeled as it is. THEMIS can cope with all kinds of inconsistencies
appearing during the student modeling.THEMIS can model students with
inconsistent knowledge in their heads as it is in order to give a
tutoring module information necessary for performing Socratic
tutoring. THEMIS is implemented in CESP:Common ESP, a logic-based
object-oriented language on a Unix workstation.

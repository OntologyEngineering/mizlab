This paper discusses the ontology problem for knowledge sharing and
reuse. Firstly, a brief survey of knowledge processing is given
followed by analysis of the preventing factors in knowledge sharing
and reuse.  Then, we classify the approaches to the goal into two
groups: direct and indirect methods. We identify two types of
ontologies such as content ontology and communication ontology
associated with each of the groups. Content ontology is further
divided into two kinds of ontologies: task ontology and domain
ontology. Task ontology is discussed in depth together with some
examples. Finally, some research on content ontology in Japan is
presented.

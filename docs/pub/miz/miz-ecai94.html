<P><B>Abstract:</B> This paper presents a task ontology which plays a
crucial role in reusing expertise. We first discuss basic issues
concerning ontology for knowledge reuse. The first issue is typology
of ontology stressing that there is more than one kind of ontology.
The second topic is context. In order to enable knowledge sharing and
reuse, knowledge should be decompiled into context-dependent and
context-independent parts. In problem solving knowledge, the context
is determined mainly by task structure. Based on this observation, we
propose a task ontology which contributes to making the problem
solving context explicit. After discussing these issues we show how
to design task ontology. Finally, an overview of a task analysis
interview system, MULTIS, based on task ontology is presented to
illustrate how an implemented task ontology is used.</P>

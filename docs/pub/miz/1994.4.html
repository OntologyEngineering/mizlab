This paper summarizes our research activities concerning FITS, a
framework for ITS, and discusses the major results obtained thus far. 
FITS is a domain-independent framework developed to examine what
functions can be realized within a domain-independent framework among
those which are needed in ITS. In the current implementation, FITS is
composed of six building blocks, each of which covers an essential
task for teaching.  This means that FITS is a realization of a
configuration of the ITS task structure from the viewpoint of
generality. FITS has been implemented in Common ESP on a UNIX
workstation. Two prototype systems for geography and chemical
reactions have been developed using FITS through which the feasibility
of FITS is proved.

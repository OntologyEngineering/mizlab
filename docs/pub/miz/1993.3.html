The aim of this research efforts is to develop a method for
automating knowledge acquisition, that can be employed to generate
knowledge-based systems, making few initial constraints on the type of
problem solving mechanism. This method is based on the following
principles: (1) problem solving can be described with primitives that
can be reused and rearranged to model problem solving processes in
various domains and task types, and (2) there exist enough formal
prorblem solving mechanisms in algorithmic form to implement those
models in a machine understandable code, or at least those mechanisms
can be easily developed by computer experts.

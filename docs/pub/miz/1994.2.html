Learning is defined as a process of obtaining results which
contribute to improvement of the performance of problem solving. In
most EBL systems, the efficiency of problem solving is adopted as a
measure of the performance. This is the reason why utility problem has
been one of the most popular topics in EBL community. From a practical
point of view, however, it is necessary to consider not only utility
but also usability of leaning results. In spite of that users'
requirements are reflected on the usability measure in many cases,
little effort has been devoted to usability research as compared with
utility one. This is one of the reasons why EBL has been behind in
applicability to real world problems in comparison with SBL. 
Considering the fact that EBL is a framework which reorganizes the
domain theory into useful one, EBL should cope with users' various
performance measures which direct the reorganization process of the
domain theory.
<P>
In this paper, we propose EBL/CV which is an extended version of EBL
by introducing some new measures of the performance, called comparison
viewpoints, which represent users' demands and are effectively
reflected on the learning process. We formalize the refinement process
of explanation structure including the generalization process of EBL,
and improve the usability of learning descriptions by introducing
comparison knowledge to that process. EBL/CV is expected to facilitate
application of EBL to real world problems.

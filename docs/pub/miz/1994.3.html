A user's utterance model and a coopeartive answering model are
proposed for question-answering systems. Many models for cooprative
answering have been developed since early 1980s and have shown taht
they can achieve some form of cooperative ansers. However, the
coverage of each mdoel has been limited. In this paper, we popose a
model that covers various types of cooperative answers. The paper
starts with the user's utterance model that relates an utterance with
its intentions. Then, it classifies cooperative answers into several
classes and discusses the relations between the user's intentions and
the classified answers. An intention recognition mechanism is then
developed employing domain-independent rules and knowledge about the
topic object. The recognition intentions are used to generate
appropriate cooperative responses. The proposed model is verified by
a prototype system that we developed.

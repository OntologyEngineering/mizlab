<P><B>Abstract:</B></P>

<P>The main purpose of this paper is to illustrate the
characteristics of ontology-based authoring tools for Computer Based
Training (CBT) systems. It has two major advantages as follows. (A)
It provides human-friendly primitives in terms of which users can
easily describe their own model of a task(descriptiveness,
readability). (B) It can simulate the abstract behavior of the model
in terms of conceptual level primitives (conceptual level
operationality). In this paper, we will discuss the basic issues on
the concept of task ontology and then describe the design principle
of an ontology-based authoring tool for Computer Based Training (CBT)
systems.</P>

Automated knowledge acquisition is an ultimate goal of knowledge
engineering.  To achieve this we have to solve many problems such as
lack of reusability and sharability of knowledge, which is one of the
serious shortcomings in the current knowledge base technology, to fill
the conceptual gap between the computer and domain experts and so on.
The authors have been involved in the research of knowledge
acquisition and knowledge reuse.  This paper is concerned with task
ontology and its use in a task analysis interview system MULTIS.  We
first discuss the knowledge reusability to identify appropriate task
ontology.  Then, we introduce a two-level mediating representation
which contributes to bridging the gap.  Generic vocabulary and
building blocks are the major components of the mediating
representation. Finally, we present a rough image of how MULTIS works.
MULTIS has been implemented in Macintosh Common Lisp and C.
This paper reviews the ITS research done by the authors. Their
works have been mainly concerned with designing a generic framework
for ITS named FITS. Especially, a lot of efforts are devoted to
developing a powerful student modeling system based on logic
programming. The framework is composed of several building blocks
designed as domain-independent problem solvers corresponding to
generic tasks appearing in tutoring behavior. It also has a scheduler
for flexible decision making on internal task arrangement. Details of
several modules are discussed using a prototype system concerning
geography developed based on FITS as an example.

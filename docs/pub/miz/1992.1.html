This paper reviews the ITS research done by the authors. Their
works have been mainly concerned with designing a generic framework
for ITS named FITS. Especially, a lot of efforts are devoted to
developing a powerful student modeling system based on logic
programming. The framework is composed of several building blocks
designed as domain-independent problem solvers corresponding to
generic tasks appearing in tutoring behavior. It also has a scheduler
for flexible decision making on internal task arrangement. Details of
several modules are discussed using a prototype system concerning
geography developed based on FITS as an example.

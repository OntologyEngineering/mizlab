<P>One of the major educational significance of the collaborative
learning has is to enhance the participants' motivation to awaken
mature reflection on their own understanding and externalize the
result of it. Our interest here is to clearly grasp such educational
significance of collaborative learning group. That is, how to
characterize the organization of learning group, what functions the
learning group has, in what situation a form of group is appropriate
for, and so on. Based on the deep understanding of the property of
the learning group, we try to build a model learning group formation.
We call the model "Opportunistic Group Formation". The term
opportunistic implies that the model can prescribe the right
situation to form the leaning group. At ordinary situation, each
learner is a series of tasks in individual learning environment. Once
the opportunistic group formation model finds that the situation of a
learner is the right timing to shift the learning mode from
individual learning to the collaborative learning, the system taking
charge of the learner proposes other systems to begin the negotiation
for form the learning group formation. The negotiation is conducted
by the negotiation process model which constitutes a part of the
opportunistic group formation model. In this paper, among various
issues on the negotiation process, we concentrate on the system of
concepts to characterize the learning groups and the negotiation
model for opportunistic group formation.</P>

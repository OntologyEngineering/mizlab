Expert systems are viewed as knowledge-based systems which efficiently
solve real-world problems based on the expertise contained in their
knowledge bases elicited from domain experts. A number of expert
systems have been developed in every industry and its utility has been
very much appreciated. This paper consists of two parts. The first
part is an introduction to experts systems in which a few basic
concepts of expert systems including basic architecture, inference
engine, and several characteristics are described as well as
advantages and limitations. The last part is concerned with the
advanced knowledge base technology. Two approaches aiming to overcome
the major shortcomings are described in turn. Deep knowledge with
knowledge compilation and task analysis for task knowledge
sharing/reuse are two of the main issues. The future direction of
expert system research is also discussed.

Nonmonotonicities of students' behavior and the student model
inference process itself are discussed including the usage of the
model in tutoring.  They are classified into two classes, i.e., single
world contradictions and multi-world contradictions (student knowledge
contradictions).  Student knowledge contradictions are the essentials
of the learning processes of a student.  This paper presents a new
perspective to capture them formulating a student discrimination
structure.  A student model description language SMDL and modeling
algorithm HSMIS, which is a nonmonotonic inductive student modeling
system, are formulated to cope with single world contradictions.  SMDL
is based on a logic programming language taking 4 truth values.
THEMIS is a new nonmonotonic and inductive model inference system
which incorporates deKleer's ATMS as a vehicle for formulating both
nonmonotonicities (contradictions).  The formulated THEMIS embodies
advanced representation power, sufficiently high adaptability and
generality.  Not only can it follow a student's change of
understanding, but it can model a student who has inconsistent
knowledge.

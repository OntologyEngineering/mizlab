Although a lot of researchers have pointed out the significance of
functional representation,the general relations between function and
behavior is not fully understood yet.We consider the knowledge of each
component in a system as consisting of two elements.  One is a
necessary and sufficient concept for simulation of the component which
we call behavior. The other is the interpretation of the behavior
under a desirable state which the component is expected to
achieve,which we call function.By classification of a primitives
necessary for the interpretation of the behavior in various domains,
which we call ``domain ontology'',we can capture and represent the
function by selection and combination of the primitives.  This paper
proposes the primitives we identified and the method to use them for
representing function. Also we investigate the relation between
function and behavior based on the primitives.As the primitives can
represent concepts at various levels of abstraction,they will
contribute to those tasks which rely on the simulations on the model
of the target object, such as diagnosis, design, explanation, and so
on.

<H2>1. INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>Building an IES(Intelligent Educational System) requires a lot of
work. It is always built from scratch. Little functional components
are reusable and we cannot compare or assess the existing systems. In
order to design an IES, the designer has to know what an intelligent
educational system is, that is, what functions are necessary for
his/her goal of education, what components are necessary for what
functionality, how to specify each component, what architecture is
appropriate for the goal, how to control the behavior of the
components, etc. Issues here include how much we know about these
fundamental characteristics of an IES. Although there have been much
philosophical discussion and implementation of IESs, there is little
in between the two. What we usually see are very abstract discussions
and idiosyncratic implementations(Wenger, 1987). These discrepancies
are mainly caused by the lack of knowledge engineering of IESs.</P>

<P>What we need for filling up this gap are well-designed common
vocabulary and frameworks for educational systems. We also need to
formalize educational tasks at the right level of abstraction. We
need to explicitly define learner's and system's roles and tasks in
educational processes. We are able to find a nice solution to this
problem in knowledge engineering.</P>

<P>Knowledge engineering has been considered as technology of
building expert systems. It has contributed to eliciting expertise,
organizing it into a computational structure, and building knowledge
bases. While rule base technology has dominated until recently, a new
technology based on knowledge modeling has appeared such as KADS
project in Europe(Wielinga, 1983), PROTEGE project in USA(Puerta,
1992), and MULTIS project in Japan(Mizoguchi, 1992)(Mizoguchi, 1995).
All these technologies are originated from the idea of Generic
tasks(Chandra, 1986) and heuristic classification(Clancey, 1985). The
latest knowledge engineering technology comes up with an idea of task
ontology which serves as a theory of vocabulary/concepts used as
building blocks for knowledge-based systems(Mizoguchi, 1993, 1995).
We consider ontology consists of task ontology which characterizes
the computational architecture of knowledge-based systems and domain
ontology which characterizes the domain knowledge.</P>

<P>Task ontology provides us with an effective methodology and
vocabulary for both analyzing and synthesizing knowledge-based
systems which IESs belong to(Van Marcke, 1995). Ontology is not only
a pure theory in fundamental AI. Rather, it is becoming a research
field called "Ontology Engineering"(Mizoguchi, 1996) like "Knowledge
engineering" in expert systems. Ontology provides us with what we
need to overcome the shortcomings the current IESs have we discussed
above.</P>

<P>This paper discusses how task ontology contributes to
characterizing and formalizing IESs and hence to facilitating
reusable functional component design. The next section describes what
an ontology is. Section 3 discusses task ontology as well as its
roles in IES research. In section 4 we discuss preliminary taxonomy
of concepts playing important roles in characterizing IESs. We
demonstrate the utility of task ontology by describing WEST(Burton,
1982) and GUIDON(Clancey, 1982) in section 5. In Appendix, a small
portion of Ontolingua(Gruber, 1992) implementation of task ontology
designed up to now is shown.</P>

<H2>2. WHAT IS AN ONTOLOGY?</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>2.1 Simple definitions</H3>

<P>Three simple definitions are given below.</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Ontology is a term in philosophy and its meaning is "Theory of
   existence".</LI>
   
   <LI>In AI, ontology is defined as "An explicit representation of
   conceptualization" (Gruber, 1992).</LI>
   
   <LI>In KB community, ontology is defined as "a system of primitive
   vocabulary/concepts used for building artificial
   systems"(Mizoguchi, 1993). Although these are compact, it is not
   sufficient for in-depth understanding what an ontology is. A more
   comprehensive definition is given in the next subsection.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>2.2 Comprehensive definitions</H3>

<P>Clarification of the differences among taxonomy, terminology,
vocabulary, and ontology and explain axioms and axiom-equivalents is
done here.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>(1) Terminology</B></P>

<P>We need to discuss the labels of concepts after coming to an
agreement on the meaning of them. Terminology is a theory of labels
of concepts.</P>

<P><B>(2) Vocabulary</B></P>

<P>A set of words. Each word indicates some concepts, so it is
similar to ontology. But vocabulary is language-dependent, so it
lacks the universality. (We sometimes find a concept which we cannot
find any one word in our language for it.) Vocabulary is weak in
description of the relations among the terms in it. As for
vocabulary, labels exist first, then what concept does each label
indicate is discussed contrary to terminology.</P>

<P><B>(3) Taxonomy</B></P>

<P>Taxonomy is also similar to ontology. It is often a hierarchy of
concepts in which each link is a is-a link or a part-of link. Roughly
speaking, ontology is a taxonomy of concepts in which each concept is
clearly defined.</P>

<P><B>(4) Ontology</B></P>

<P>Following Guarino(Guarino, 95), we use the convention in which
capital letter "O" is used to distinguish the "Ontology" in
philosophy from others. "Ontology" is a theory which can answer
questions such as "what is existence", "What properties exist common
to all the existence", "what properties can explain the existence",
"How these properties explain the existence", etc.</P>

<P><B>(5) ontology</B></P>

<P>The design methodology is like one for Ontology, but the target is
different from it. Not the "existence" but smaller and concrete thing
such as enterprise, thermo-dynamics, problem solving, tutoring, etc.
are discussed. We define an ontology as an explicit and unambiguous
description of concepts and relations among them appearing in the
target thing. Such ontologies exist as many as the possible target
things. We do not have to use logic to describe it.</P>

<P><B>(6) Formal ontology</B></P>

<P>Axiomatic description of an ontology. It can answer questions on
the capability of ontology.</P>

<P><B>(7) Axiom</B></P>

<P>Declaratively and rigorously represented knowledge which has to be
accepted without proof. In predicate logic case, a formal inference
engine is implicitly assumed to exist. But, anyone seldom mention
it.</P>

<P>An axiom has two roles as follows in ontology description: 1) To
represent the meaning of concepts rigorously. 2) Within the scope of
the knowledge represented declaratively, to answer the questions on
the capability of the ontology and things built using the concepts in
the ontology.</P>

<P>Questions about the capability of ontology plays an important role
in its evaluation and they are divided into the following two: 1)
Questions on the formal properties of the ontology and things
designed using ontology. 2) Questions on the behavior of the things
designed using the ontology.</P>

<P>The former is called "competence" question and the latter
"performance" question. Axioms written in predicate calculus are
sufficient for answering the former. To answer the latter question,
however, we often need procedural engines to interpret the meaning of
concepts in the ontology because declarative knowledge with a formal
prover cannot answer all the questions. To cope with such situations,
we introduce axiom equivalents defined as follows:</P>

<P><B>(8) Axiom equivalent</B></P>

<P>An axiom equivalent is not a rigorous or declarative axiom based
on formal inference engine, but it is partially declarative knowledge
based also on interpretation by a procedural engine to answer
performance questions. Axiom equivalent do not have to be formalized
completely.</P>

<P>The difference between axioms and axiom equivalents is essential.
"Axioms" can be also interpreted as "small number of rules which are
represented in a declarative form and can derive all the facts from
them". It is true they contribute to making the characteristics of
technology clear and explicit if it is represented in a declarative
form using axioms. This also applies to ontology. In fact, many
researchers have been trying to represent ontology formally. However,
we could say such an attempt neglects the reality. It is obvious that
declarative and formal methodology cannot cope with the performance
of the knowledge required by knowledge engineering. For example, if
we adopted the first order predicate calculus, we have to abandon
dealing with the knowledge such as "mathematical induction is sound
for all the predicates". What we should do for knowledge engineering
is to adopt not only formal approaches but also informal ones such as
natural language representation and axiom equivalents based on
procedural interpretation. This will enable ontology research to
contribute to the future knowledge processing community.</P>

<H2>3. TASK ONTOLOGY</H2>

<H3>3.1 What is a task ontology?</H3>

<P>Task ontology is a system/theory of vocabulary for describing
inherent problem solving structure of all the existing tasks
domain-independently. It is obtained by analyzing task structures of
real world problems. Design of task ontology is done in order to
overcome the shortcomings of generic tasks(Chandra, 86) while
preserving their basic philosophies. It does not cover the control
structure but do components or primitives of unit inferences taking
place during performing tasks. The ultimate goal of task ontology
research includes to provide theory of all the vocabulary necessary
for building a model of human problem solving process.</P>

<P>When we view a problem solving process based on search as a
sentence of natural language, task ontology is a system of semantic
vocabulary for representing meaning of the sentence. The
determination of the abstraction level of task ontology requires a
close consideration on granularity and generality. Representations of
the two sentences of the same meaning in terms of task ontology
should be the same. These observations suggest task ontology consists
of the following four kinds of concepts:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Generic nouns representing objects reflecting their roles
   appearing in the problem solving</LI>
   
   <LI>process,</LI>
   
   <LI>Generic verbs representing unit activities appearing in the
   problem solving process,</LI>
   
   <LI>Generic adjectives modifying the objects, and</LI>
   
   <LI>Other concepts specific to the task.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Task ontology for scheduling tasks, for example, looks as
follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<DL>
   <DT><B>Nouns:</B></DT>
   
   <DD>"Scheduling recipient", "Scheduling resource", "Due date",
   "Schedule", "Constraints", "Goal", "Priority", etc.</DD>
   
   <DT><B>Verbs:</B></DT>
   
   <DD>"Assign", "Classify", "Pick up", "Select", "Relax", "Neglect",
   etc.</DD>
   
   <DT><B>Adjectives</B> :</DT>
   
   <DD>"Unassigned", "The last", "Idle" etc.</DD>
   
   <DT><B>Others:</B></DT>
   
   <DD>"Strong constraint", "Constraint satisfaction", "Constraint
   predicates", "Attribute", etc.</DD>
</DL>

<P>Verbs are defined as a set of procedures representing its
operational meaning. So, they collectively serve as a set of reusable
components for building IESs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>3.2 Roles of task ontology in IES</H3>

<P>Roles of task ontology include:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>To provide vocabulary/concepts in terms of which one can
   compare and assess existing IESs.</LI>
   
   <LI>To formalize educational tasks.</LI>
   
   <LI>To specify the tutoring/training context which contributes to
   making it easy to put domain knowledge into a right context, since
   it provides us with abstract roles of various objects which could
   be instantiated to domain-specific objects.</LI>
   
   <LI>To provide reusable components for IES design and
   development.</LI>
   
   <LI>To enable translation of the knowledge-level description of
   the problem solving process into symbol-level executable
   code.</LI>
   
   <LI>To standardize communication protocol among component agents
   of IES in CSCL(Ikeda, 95).</LI>
</OL>

<H2>4. PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF TASK ONTOLOGY OF IESs</H2>

<P>We are currently designing task ontology for IESs and trying to
represent it in an ontology description language. Because the
research is at an initial stage, we only present a preliminary
results of task ontology design in this section.</P>

<P>The top-level categories of task ontology of IESs consist of Goals
of education, Learner's state, System's functionality, Learner-system
interaction, and Teaching material knowledge because an IES is
characterized as an interaction between a system and a learner in
which the system's activity is based on its functionality which is
performed in a domain according to the learner's state under a
certain goal. Then, we have the following top level categories of
concepts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<PRE>
Top-level concepts of IESs
	Goals of education
	Learner's state
	System's functionality
	Learner-system interaction
	Teaching material knowledge
</PRE>

<P>In the following hierarchical organization of concepts are
composed of nodes linked by the three kinds of links such as Is-a,
Part-of, and Has-attribute. The default is Is-a link, "+" indicates
Part-of link and "*" has-attribute link.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>4.1 Goals of education</H3>

<P>Let us investigate Goals first. There have been proposed a number
of paradigms for IESs to date. While they are seemingly conflicting
each other, the reality is not. When we carefully investigate the
paradigms, we easily understand most of the them can co-exist, since
they have different</P>

<P>educational goals. In this sense, goals enable one to distinguish
and identify an appropriate paradigm for his purpose.</P>

<P>Goals of education are first divided into two categories such as
augmentation of "Domain-independent" and "Domain-dependent
capabilities". The former is mainly related to reasoning capability
which has various kinds of subcapabilities. The latter is divided
into three subcategories such as "Deep understanding of
concepts"(declarative knowledge), "Problem solving
capability"(procedural knowledge), and Skills.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<PRE>
Goals of education/training
  Domain-independent capability
    Memory
      Long-term memory
      Short-term memory

          Negotiation
  Domain-dependent capability
    Deep understanding of concepts
      Learning of new concepts
      In-depth understanding of the new concepts
      Assimilation of the concept/knowledge
      Thorough understanding through its use
    Problem solving capability
      Typical problem solving schema
        Basic schema
          Knowledge compilation
        Advanced schema
          Diagnosis
          Repair
          ....
      Solving a problem by using a known schema
      Modifying schema or combine several schema
      Creating a new problem solving schema
    Skills
</PRE>

<H3>4.2 Learner's state</H3>

<P>Learner's state is composed of "Phase in learning process",
"Knowledge state", and "Mental state". Subcategories of the first are
similar to those under the domain-dependent capability under Goals of
education. "Knowledge state" consists of "Numerical representation"
and "Symbolic representation". "Symbolic representation" is composed
of two components such as "Location of bugs" and "Types of bugs".</P>

        Incorrect order of operations
 +Mental state
    Motivation
    Concentration
    Willingness
    ....
</PRE>

<H3>4.3 System's functionality</H3>

<P>Needless to say, system's functionality is the most important
category in IESs. The top level concepts are concerning how to teach
which characterizes the type of IESs. Assuming autonomous systems, it
is composed of:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<PRE>
Autonomous systems
  One-to-one interaction
    Repetitive practice
    Learning by doing
    Free exploration in a learning environment
    Interactive learning environment
    Coaching
    Tutoring
    Training
  Group learning
    Collaboration
    Coordination
    Cooperation
    Game-playing
    Argumentation
    ....
</PRE>

<P>We also identify non-autonomous systems, that is, tools used with
the aid of a human teacher. In this paper, however, we only discuss
tutoring systems as a typical autonomous system. Functionality of an
ITS includes "Modelling" and "Tutoring". The former characterizes
capability of an ITS to model a learner as well as the problem domain
which is critical to making an IES behave intelligently. "Tutoring"
activity is composed of "Tutoring objectives", "Control", and
"Methods". "Methods" is composed of "Actions" and "Objects". The
former includes "Help" which simply gives information required upon
request, "Getting learners motivated" which encourages and
compliments learners, "Exercise" which gives learners problems to
solve, "Guide" which gives explanation or hints appropriate for the
learner's understanding state and context, and "Evaluate/assess".
"Objects" includes "Problems", "Explanation", "Hints", and "Learner's
performance".</P>

<H3>4.4 Interaction between the system and the learner</H3>

<P>Learner's activity, both internal (mental) and external (actions,
communication) also seems to play an important role. However, as we
cannot directly assess/evaluate his/her mental activity and student
model construction mainly consists of filling the chosen framework
using learner-system communication as an information source, we will
concentrate here at "Learner-system interaction". On the top level we
suggest to characterize interaction by the following categories:

<H3>4.5 Teaching material knowledge</H3>

<P>Teaching material knowledge is a heart of education. To make it
easier to manipulate various knowledge, it is important to
characterize it in terms of a few concepts. We analyzed various
teaching material knowledge from the viewpoint of effectiveness of
tutoring strategy applied to them. We first came up with the
following:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Ease of getting a guideline of error correction</LI>
   
   <LI>Ease of acquiring necessary attribute</LI>
   
   <LI>Applicability of verification operation</LI>
   
   <LI>Amount of resource consumption of problem solving</LI>
</OL>

<P>These are factors which explain why a certain set of tutoring
strategies are not effective to a certain set of domain knowledge.
And then, we came up with the following four attributes for that
purpose. Each attribute corresponds to a factor above one by one.
Those who are interested in the detailed explanation of this
characterization, please refer(Ikeda, 1994).</P>

<P>Teaching material knowledge includes "Domain knowledge", "Search
control knowledge" and "Strategic knowledge". The first is composed
of "Nodes" and "Links". Nodes include "Concepts", "Facts", "Rules",
and "Principles". The latter "Goal", "Subgoal", "Cost/Score",
"Preference", "Focus", etc.</P>

<H2>5. SPECIFICATION OF IESs USING ONTOLOGY</H2>

<P>We here present the description of two IESs, WEST(Burton, 1982)
and GUIDON(Clancey, 1982) using our ontology.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>5.1 Rough sketch</H3>

<P>In both IESs,</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Training is aimed at DOMAIN-DEPENDENT CAPABILITY, namely
   THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING THROUGH USE of knowledge and TRAINING TO
   SOLVE A PROBLEM BY USING A KNOWN SCHEMA, addressing the same PHASE
   IN LEARNING PROCESS;</LI>
   
   <LI>DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE is represented as a set of RULES that must be
   MASTERed;</LI>
   
   <LI>STRATEGIC KNOWLEDGE is not considered;</LI>
   
   <LI>LEARNER MODEL is OVERLAY;</LI>
   
   <LI>INSTRUCTION PLANNING is DYNAMIC;</LI>
   
   <LI>LEARNER's ASSESSMENT is done continuously;</LI>
   
   <LI>Both DIRECT and INDIRECT INSTRUCTION are used.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>5.2 WEST</H3>

<P>WEST is a typical COACH system for a GAME, so it plays both the
ROLE of a COMPETITIVE PARTNER and a COACH. Therefore, COMMUNICATION
SEQUENCE is IN-TURN, breaking by Learner's HELP and System's advice
as a HINT or EXPLANATION. Regular CONTENT of COMMUNICATION is a
result of calculation. MOTIVATION is supported by GAME situation and
COMPLIMENTs from system. PROBLEM SELECTION is based on RULE in FOCUS.
FOCUSing uses one of strategies: "FOCUS on the same RULE until it is
MASTERed" or "FOCUS on the poor-known RULE that was not mentioned for
the longest time". System INTERRUPTs as a COACH only on certain
conditions (see example). The only TYPE OF BUG is LACK OF RULE.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Example of West's behavior:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<PRE>
  SELECT a PROBLEM
  GIVE (PRESENT) a PROBLEM
  ASSESS Learner's RESULT
  UPDATE LEARNER MODEL
  IF     LEARNER MODEL shows LACK OF RULE
    AND  RESULT (Problem, RULE) is much better than Learner's RESULT
   (AND  Condition to interrupt is Good )
  THEN   PRESENT ( EXPLANATION (RULE) )
         SUGGEST Learner to apply the RULE
  SELECT a PROBLEM
  SOLVE the PROBLEM
  SELECT a PROBLEM
  ....
  GIVE (PRESENT) a PROBLEM
  ASSESS Learner's RESULT
  UPDATE LEARNER MODEL
  IF     Learner's RESULT is Good
    AND  Learner's RESULT is obtained by Newly taught RULE
  THEN   COMPLIMENT
  SELECT a PROBLEM
  ....
  IF     LEARNER's ACTION is ASK_FOR_HELP
  THEN   SYSTEM's ACTION is PRESENT
        (one_of:  EXPLANATION (RULE for the BEST RESULT)
                  HINT (Possible RULES)
                  HINT (RESULTs of RULES)
                  HINT (the BEST RESULT - GOAL) )
</PRE>

<H3>5.3 GUIDON</H3>

<P>GUIDON is a TUTORING system, playing the ROLE of an EXPERT
(Diagnostician). COMMUNICATION is SYSTEM-DRIVEN, breaking by HELP and
QUESTIONs of a Learner. COMMUNICATION CONTENT includes Learner's
QUESTIONs, HYPOTHESes and FACTORs, supporting them; System's
QUESTIONs, RULEs, GOALs, and EXPLANATIONs about FACTORS, HYPOTHESES,
and RULEs. PROBLEM SELECTION is done once based on a set of chosen
RULES, then communication is within one problem. System provides
IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK. TYPE OF BUGS recognized - INCORRECT RULE
(FACTORs, HYPOTHESIS), LACK OF RULE. MOTIVATION is not
considered.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Examples of Guidon's behavior:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<PRE>
  IF     LEARNER's ACTION is ASK_FOR_HELP
    AND  FOCUS is New GOAL
  THEN   PRESENT (GOAL)
         EXPLAIN (EVALUATION (GOAL))

  IF     LEARNER's ACTION is QUESTION (Relation (FACTORS, CURRENT GOAL))
  THEN   GIVE (EXAMPLE (one_of RULEs (FACTORS, GOAL)))

  IF     LEARNER's ACTION is ASK_FOR_HELP
    AND  GOAL in FOCUS is not EXPLORED
  THEN   CHOOSE one_of (SUBGOAL)
         PRESENT (SUBGOAL)
         EXPLAIN (Relation (GOAL, SUBGOAL))
         ASK_EVALUATE (SUBGOAL)

  IF     LEARNER's ACTION is QUESTION (FACTs)
    AND  FACTs are RELEVANT to CURRENT GOAL
  THEN   PRESENT (FACTs)

  IF     GOAL in FOCUS is EXPLORED
    AND  LEARNER MODEL shows that RULE is UNKNOWN
    AND  RULE is in TOPIC
    AND  HYPOTHESIS from RULE is similar to HYPOTHESIS in FOCUS
  THEN   ASK_EVALUATE/EXPLAIN HYPOTHESIS

  IF     Learner's HYPOTHESIS is CORRECT
  THEN   Confirm (CORRECT)
         PRESENT (FACTORs) confirming HYPOTHESIS

  IF     Learner's HYPOTHESIS is WRONG
    AND  LEARNER MODEL shows that RULE which NEGATEs it is not MASTERED
  THEN   PRESENT (FACTORs) confirming HYPOTHESIS
         PRESENT (FACTORs) rejecting HYPOTHESIS
         ASK_EVALUATE relevance of FACTORs to HYPOTHESIS


  IF     GOAL is EXPLORED
    AND  HYPOTHESIS is MISSING
    AND  LEARNER MODEL has no RULE to SUPPORT it
  THEN   PRESENT (FACTORs) both RELEVANT and IRRELEVANT
         ASK_SELECT (RELEVANT FACTORs)
         EVALUATE (ANSWER)
         PRESENT (RULE)
         EXPLAIN (RULEs application)
</PRE>

<H3>5.4 Discussion</H3>

<P>Although both IESs teach to apply RULEs for Problem solving, WEST
mentions the RULE as a whole and compares RESULTs of RULE
application, whereas GUIDON discusses RULE components - FACTORS and
HYPOTHESES, existence of a RULE to connect some FACTORs to
HYPOTHESIS, and GOALs in solution process. Improved version of GUIDON
is based on NEOMYCIN framework for problem domain knowledge
representation, including concept structuring and strategic knowledge
about diagnostic problem solving. To describe these improvements
current ontology must be supplied with vocabulary to represent
diagnostic problem solving.</P>

<H2>6. CONCLUSION</H2>

<P>We have discussed ontology design and its use for IES
specification. Although the step we have made is not large, its
implications to the future research in IESs area is not small.
Because the research is in an initial stage, the ontology described
in this paper is not very rich which should be augmented further.
And, most of the description in this paper is informal. Although
informal description is easy to understand by humans, they are
sometimes ambiguous and computer cannot understand them at all. In
order to enable computers manipulate ontology, it has to be
formalized. Ontology for communication protocol between IESs for CSCL
is not discussed in this paper, though it is also important. A
preliminary result is found in (Ikeda, 1995). Ontology represented in
a well-defined language with declarative and procedural semantics
will contribute to formalization of IESs and hence to promotion of
IES research in general.</P>

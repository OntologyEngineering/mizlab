<p><b>Abstract:</b> We aim at supporting the complex instructional design process 
  for collaborative learning. We adopt learning theories as a basis for designing, 
  analyzing, and evaluating the collaborative learning session. We have brought 
  the ontological engineering technique into our approach. Up to the present, 
  we have built a collaborative learning ontology and formulated collaborative 
  learning models in terms of the ontology. Currently, laying the ontology and 
  the<br>
  model as basis, we have been conducting a project aiming at developing various 
  kinds of ID support system for collaborative learning. In this paper, we will 
  describe an overview of our Collaborative Learning Ontology, and then present 
  two systems to support the instructional design process for collaborative learning: 
  a group formation support system, and an interaction analysis support system.<br>

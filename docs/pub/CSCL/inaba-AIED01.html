<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this research we are aiming at supporting complex instructional 
  design (ID) process for CSCL environment. To fulfill the aim we have been constructing 
  an ontology to represent computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) session. 
  The ontology will work as both vocabulary to describe the session and design 
  pattern referred to during the instructional design process. In this paper, 
  we describe the ID process for CSCL, our approach to support it, and propose 
  the ID support environment with some repositories whose data are described by 
  common vocabulary. We show part of vocabulary and design patterns based on our 
  Collaborative Learning Ontology as examples. Then we introduce an ID support 
  tool using the repositories as an example. The tool will help human users to 
  analyze complex interaction process in collaborative learning.<br>

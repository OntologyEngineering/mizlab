<p><b>Abstract:</b> We can observe various kinds of interaction among members 
  of a learning group during collaborative learning session. It is difficult for 
  even human users to analyze them in order to clarify what types of collaboration 
  have occurred in the session and what educational benefits have been expected 
  for the members through the session. So, we propose an interaction analysis 
  support system that helps users to abstract essence of interaction from raw 
  protocol data, and to understand what types of collaboration have been occurred 
  in the session, and then infers educational benefits expected to be gained by 
  the members through the interaction process.<br>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
From a viewpoint of Ågknowledge managementÅh, collaborative space for learning is an aid to encourage organizational members (e.g. employee) to acquire or create important organizational intellect (e.g. knowledge) through group activity (e.g. a free discussion). In this paper we focus on design of collaborative space, which is a key for organization to grow, and aim to improve the quality of collaborative space by establishing a rational design principle and developing design support system. To arraign the goal, we have been building collaborative space ontology as a foundation of the environment, and developing a collaborative space design support system which provides designers with design guideline and the support functions based on collaborative space ontology.

<P><B>Abstract: </B>The idea that the next generation computer-based
training (CBT) systems should incorporate many innovative concepts in
the acquisition, representation, and management of expert knowledge
and common-sense knowledge is now widely accepted among the
researchers. The system which we call Smart Trainer is a CBT system
including a set of simulators for facility of electric power systems.
The development of Smart Trainer is partly motivated by the need for
a powerful authoring system of Intelligent CBT systems. We think the
specification authoring systems should be clarified in many
viewpoints, for example, what role each component should play, to
what extent the knowledge-bases should cover, to what degree of the
fidelity of cognitive model should be pursued, and so on. In
knowledge engineering, the research on a system of the concepts
appeared in the domain of a knowledge-based system, called ÉÅontology
engineeringÉÇ[Mizoguchi, 1995], attracts much attention of
AI-researchers. So, to put the goal of the Smart Trainer in other
words, we have been aiming at clarifying the ontology of CBTsystems
from the knowledge engineering viewpoint. The expected advantages of
explicit representation of ontology and its use are summarized as
follows.</P>

<OL>
   <LI>1. Because the ontology plays a role as fundamental scheme for
   authoring the contents, it provides authors with a right viewpoint
   for organizing training tasks of interest.
   
   <LI>2. Because the functionality realized in a certain CBT system
   is explicitly specified by the ontology, the author can fully
   understand its capability in terms of human friendly primitives.
   
   <LI>3. Once the educational knowledge and the contents of training
   tasks are organized under the ontology, they can be shared among
   authors.
   
   <LI>4. The behavior of CBT can be self-explanatory in terms of
   ontology. In addition, it can be justified by the first principle
   behind the CBT ontology.
   
   <LI>5. Because the functionality of CBT is represented in a right
   level of abstraction, it is easy to replace an out-of-date
   component of the system with one of the latest style.
</OL>

<P>In this paper, as a preliminary step to CBT ontology design, we
briefly explain the principle behind the Smart Trainer. Let discuss
little more generally about ontology and intelligent educational
systems(IES) before going to CBT ontology.</P>

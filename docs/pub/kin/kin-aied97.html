<P><B>Abstract: </B>With the advancement in technology, computers
have been used for training novice operators, for it is more
cost-effective than the real system, and with the recent development
of Multi-Media technology, a simulator environment can be realized in
computer just like a real-time control system. But on the other hand,
the more complex and the more advanced the technology is, the more
difficult to make a teaching material for computer. That is to say,
it will take a lot of time for an author to make a good teaching
material including simulations so that the learner can master it
easily. Because there is a large gap between the concepts of authors
and the concepts for computer, it feels difficult to save more time
for the author. In order to solve such a problem, we think the
ontology technology is needed, and it is now widely accepted among
the researchers. The system which we call SmartTrainer is a CBT
(Computer Based Training) system including a set of simulators for
facility of electric power systems. The development of SmartTrainer
is partly motivated by the need for a powerful authoring system of
Intelligent CBT systems. Of course, here we do not just want to
discuss how to make an authoring system itself which can be used
easily only, we also emphasize on what the simulation is from the
view of training task.</P>

<P>In this paper, as a preliminary step, we will mention the
intelligent training system itself, and then explain what is ontology
which is used as a base for making our Intelligent Training System.
At last, we will briefly discuss the designing of authoring
environment based on ontology in Smart Trainer.</P>

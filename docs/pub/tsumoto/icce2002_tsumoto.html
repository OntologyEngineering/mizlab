<p><b>Abstract:</b> 

Intellectual synergy is a major source of high competitive power for an organization. Through our research project, we have been developing an environment, Kfarm, to support creating/inheriting organizational intellect. Characteristic features of Kfarm include a Dual Loop Model which represents ideal processes of knowledge-level communication among personnel to create/inherit organizational knowledge. In this paper, we focus on collaborative learning support functions of Kfarm. This research seeks to clarify the essential role of collaborative learning in an organization and provide an appropriate opportunity for collaborative learning for organization members. Attaining the goal requires construction of a design model of collaborative learning and realization of design support functions into Kfarm. This paper first introduces learning aspects of organizational activities. Then, it roughly outlines Kfarm while focusing on collaborative learning support functions.

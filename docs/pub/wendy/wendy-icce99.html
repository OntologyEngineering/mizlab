<b>Title:</b> Communication Content Ontology for Learner Model Agent in Multi-agent 
Architecture<br>

<p><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we describe domain-independent concepts in message 
  content in a multi-agent architecture of Intelligent Educational Systems (IES). 
  Although it is well accepted that a common ontology holds the key to fluent 
  communication between agents, most researchers believe that the common ontology 
  is domain ontology. This has been one of the causes of the fact that the work 
  on agent communication has concentrated on general-purpose languages with communication 
  performatives. In IES research, however, we can find task-dependent but domain-independent 
  content, which we could ÅgontologizeÅh. By domain, we here mean subject domains 
  such as geometry, chemistry, and mathematics, etc. In the multi-agent architecture 
  of IES, we examined the information exchanged between the learner model agent 
  and other agents, and abstracted the domain-independent concepts. We represent 
  them explicitly and domain-independently, to build an ontology. By so doing, 
  we believe that we can move toward a standard for the communication between 
  agents in educational systems, so that the modules/agents can be reused. In 
  this paper we discuss in detail the ontological issues in the message content, 
  and give some examples to show the ontology, that we have designed.

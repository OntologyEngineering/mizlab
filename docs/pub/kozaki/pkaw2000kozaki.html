<p><b>Abstract:</b> A methodology of ontology design and a computer system supporting 
  ontology design are needed. Our research goals include a methodology for ontology 
  design and developing an environment for building and using ontologies. Although 
  several systems for building ontologies have been implemented, they do not consider 
  enough ontological theory. We discuss how to apply the "role-concept" and "relationship" 
  in our environment, named Hozo, for creating and using ontologies. We present 
  the architecture, functionalities of its modules, its interface and the different 
  possibilities for the design and use of ontologies. </p>

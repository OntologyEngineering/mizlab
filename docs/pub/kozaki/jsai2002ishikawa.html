<p><b>Abstract:</b> Recently, ontology is expected to contribute to sharing and 
  reuse of knowledge, and a lot of research on ontology has been carried out. 
  However, useful methodologies for building ontologies are not yet established 
  in spite of the understanding of its necessity. The crucial point of building 
  ontologies is to articulate concepts in the target field. If a concept is defined 
  in a manner depending on a particular context, it is difficult to reuse it in 
  other contexts. Therefore, it is important to distinguish context-dependent 
  concepts from context-independent ones. The difficulty of the discrimination 
  requires development of a methodology and a guide system for building ontologies. 
  This paper proposes AFM (Activity-First Method), a methodology of building domain 
  ontology depending on task analysis, and an ontology building guide system based 
  on AFM. The guide system supports building ontologies by providing an ontology 
  author with building steps, and managing intermediate results. In the first 
  half of this paper, we take an ontology of oil refinery plant operation task 
  as an example and discuss articulation of the role concepts. Role concepts represent 
  conceptual categories of roles of matters in a particular context. This consideration 
  serves as the foundation of this guide system. In the second half of this paper, 
  we show how the guide system supports an ontology building process.</p>

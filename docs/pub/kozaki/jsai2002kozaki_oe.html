<p><b>Abstract:</b> Recently, an ontology is expected to contribute to knowledge 
  sharing and euse. It is,however, difficult to develop well-organized ontologies 
  because the principles of ontology design are not clear enough. Therefore, a 
  methodology for ontology design and a computer system supporting ontology design 
  are needed. Our research goals include a methodology of ontology design, and 
  development of an environment for building and using ontologies. Building an 
  ontology requires a clear understanding of what can be concepts with what relations 
  to others. An ontology thus focuses on ÅgconceptsÅh themselves rather than ÅgrepresentationÅh 
  of them. Although several systems for building ontologies have been developed 
  to date, they were not based on enough consideration of an ontological theory. 
  We argue that a fundamental consideration of these ontological theories is needed 
  to develop an environment for developing ontologies. Most of the previous ontologies, 
  which are represented in frame-based languages,don't clearly deal with such 
  concepts that need deep ontological investigation. Therefore we begin with a 
  fundamental consideration of an ontological theory. We discuss mainly Ågrole 
  conceptÅh and ÅgrelationshipÅh, and consider how these ontologically important 
  concepts should be treated in our environment. On the basis of the consideration 
  we have designed and have developed an environment for building and using ontologies, 
  named ÅgHozoÅh. This paper presents an outline of the functionality of Hozo. We 
  focus on how it treats the relations and roles on the basis of fundamental consideration.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Ontological engineering is a successor of knowledge engineering 
  which has been considered as a technology for building knowledge-intensive systems. 
  Although knowledge engineering has contributed to eliciting expertise, organizing 
  it into a computational structure, and building knowledge bases, AI researchers 
  have noticed the necessity of a more robust and theoretically sound engineering 
  which enables knowledge sharing/reuse and formulation of the problem solving 
  process itself. Knowledge engineering has thus developed into Ågontological engineeringÅh 
  where ÅgontologyÅh is the key concept to investigate. Although the necessity of 
  an ontology and ontological engineering is well-understood, there has been few 
  success stories about ontology construction and its deployment to date. The 
  reason for this is that the principles of ontology design is not clear enough. 
  Therefore, a methodology of ontology design and a computer system supporting 
  ontology design are needed. Our research goals include a methodology of ontology 
  design, and development of an environment for building and using ontologies. 
  This article outlines an environment for building and using ontologies ÅgHozoÅh 
  which is under development. Hozo is designed based on a fundamental consideration 
  of an ontological theory. And it has been extensively used in many projects 
  to develop various ontologies. As an example, this paper presents an activity 
  of ontology construction and its deployment in an interface system for an oil-refinery 
  plant operation which has been done under the umbrella of Human-Media Project 
  for five years. And we demonstrate the ability of Hozo through the ontology 
  building/using process.</p>

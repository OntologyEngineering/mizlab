<p><b>Abstract:</b> We have developed an environment for building/using ontologies, 
  named Hozo, based on both of a fundamental consideration of an ontological theory 
  and a methodology of building an ontology. Since Hozo is based on an ontological 
  theory of a role-concept, it can distinguish concepts dependent on particular 
  contexts from so-called basic concepts and contribute to building reusable ontologies.

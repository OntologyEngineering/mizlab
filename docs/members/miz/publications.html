Abstract:
   This paper reviews the ITS research done by the authors. Their
works have been mainly concerned with designing a generic framework
for ITS named FITS. Especially, a lot of efforts are devoted to
developing a powerful student modeling system based on logic
programming. The framework is composed of several building blocks
designed as domain-independent problem solvers corresponding to
generic tasks appearing in tutoring behavior. It also has a scheduler
for flexible decision making on internal task arrangement. Details of
several modules are discussed using a prototype system concerning
geography developed based on FITS as an example.

Abstract
   Automated knowledge acquisition is an ultimate goal of knowledge
engineering.  To achieve this we have to solve many problems such as
lack of reusability and sharability of knowledge, which is one of the
serious shortcomings in the current knowledge base technology, to fill
the conceptual gap between the computer and domain experts and so on.
The authors have been involved in the research of knowledge
acquisition and knowledge reuse.  This paper is concerned with task
ontology and its use in a task analysis interview system MULTIS.  We
first discuss the knowledge reusability to identify appropriate task
ontology.  Then, we introduce a two-level mediating representation
which contributes to bridging the gap.  Generic vocabulary and
building blocks are the major components of the mediating
representation. Finally, we present a rough image of how MULTIS works.
MULTIS has been implemented in Macintosh Common Lisp and C.

Proceedings of the International Conference on Expert Systems

Abstract:
   Expert systems are viewed as knowledge-based systems which
efficiently solve real-world problems based on the expertise contained
in their knowledge bases elicited from domain experts. A number of
expert systems have been developed in every industry and its utility
has been very much appreciated. This paper consists of two parts. The
first part is an introduction to experts systems in which a few basic
concepts of expert systems including basic architecture, inference
engine, and several characteristics are described as well as
advantages and limitations. The last part is concerned with the
advanced knowledge base technology. Two approaches aiming to overcome
the major shortcomings are described in turn. Deep knowledge with
knowledge compilation and task analysis for task knowledge
sharing/reuse are two of the main issues. The future direction of
expert system research is also discussed.

Abstract:
   The aim of this research efforts is to develop a method for
automating knowledge acquisition, that can be employed to generate
knowledge-based systems, making few initial constraints on the type of
problem solving mechanism. This method is based on the following
principles: (1) problem solving can be described with primitives that
can be reused and rearranged to model problem solving processes in
various domains and task types, and (2) there exist enough formal
prorblem solving mechanisms in algorithmic form to implement those
models in a machine understandable code, or at least those mechanisms
can be easily developed by computer experts.

Knowledge acquisition and ontology, Proc. of KB&KS'93, Tokyo, 
pp.121-128, 1993.

Abstract:
   This paper discusses the ontology problem for knowledge sharing and
reuse. Firstly, a brief survey of knowledge processing is given
followed by analysis of the preventing factors in knowledge sharing
and reuse.  Then, we classify the approaches to the goal into two
groups: direct and indirect methods. We identify two types of
ontologies such as content ontology and communication ontology
associated with each of the groups. Content ontology is further
divided into two kinds of ontologies: task ontology and domain
ontology. Task ontology is discussed in depth together with some
examples. Finally, some research on content ontology in Japan is
presented.

Nonmonotonic Student Model Inference System, Proc. of ICCE'93,
Taipei, pp.55-71, 1993.

Abstract: 
   A nonmonotonic student modeling system THEMIS based on logic
programming paradigm is described. A student model description
language named SMDL which takes four truth values is designed to
capture the student behavior. By asking questions when necessary,
THEMIS builds a student model as an SMDL program which explains the
behaviors of the student. It is designed on the basis of close
analysis of inconsistencies which are classified into four categories
according to the causes of them. Further, we identified they are
grouped into two groups: one should be resolved and the other should
be modeled as it is. THEMIS can cope with all kinds of inconsistencies
appearing during the student modeling.THEMIS can model students with
inconsistent knowledge in their heads as it is in order to give a
tutoring module information necessary for performing Socratic
tutoring. THEMIS is implemented in CESP:Common ESP, a logic-based
object-oriented language on a Unix workstation.

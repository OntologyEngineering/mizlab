PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES

Jan. 1997--Now	Post-doctoral researcher, Fellowship of Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences(JSPS). Mizoguchi Laboratory, Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Japan. Research on Ontology-based Computer-Based Training(CBT) authoring tool. The aim of this project is to construct a task ontology, which helps to model training knowledge and provides guideline for the construction of CBT systems.

Sept. 1994--July 1996	Research assistant, Department of Computer Science, Beijing, China. Designed and programmed the tool for automatic generation of intelligent tutoring systems. Its aim was to build a knowledge-based tool to generate Intelligent Tutoring Systems automatically. 

May 1992--August 1993	Research assistant, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Taiyuan, China. Designed and programmed the electronic switches operation expert system. In this project we implemented a blackboard-based expert system with Prolog.

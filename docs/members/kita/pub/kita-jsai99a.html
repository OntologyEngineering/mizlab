Although a lot of model-based diagnostic systems have been developed,
the conceptual meaning of "causes of faults" detected by them has not
been discussed clearly. We believe there are two meanings of causes of
faults, that is, the cognitive causes and the physical causes. The
former specify locations of faults (i.e., component name) as results
of cognitive interpretation based on means-ends relations among
functions of hierarchical view of functional architecture. The later
represent the states that physically cause the symptoms together with
physical causal chains among them. In this article, we define such
concepts about faults, aiming at establishing an ontology of faults. A
set of classes of faults defined in the ontology allows us to specify
the limited scope of detectable faults of conventional diagnostic
systems.

<B>Abstract:</B>
This research is concerned with causal understanding of behavior of
physical systems, which is an important topic of qualitative reasoning
systems. In this article, a causal time ontology is proposed, aiming
at explicit description of design and modeling rationales of reasoning
systems with respect to time. The ontology defines a set of causal
time units which are categories of time intervals for propagation of
change. Some conventional reasoning systems are characterized by their
causal time resolutions in terms of the time units, which show us
their implicit assumptions together with limitations. Our reasoning
system satisfying the necessary time resolution is presented. The
constituents of the model for the time resolution is also discussed.

This paper describes a diagnostic method based on the ontology of
faults. The ontology defines the concept of
the fault event for capturing faults. On the basis of the concept, we
propose a diagnostic method using the fault event models, which
represent generic state transitions which could commonly occur in
components. The categorization of causes of faults in the ontology
helps the modelers describe such generic models. The reasoning method
exhaustively generates fault hypotheses in wider range. We
also integrate the reasoning method with the conventional
methods. Moreover, the set of classes of faults in the ontology allows
users to control the scope of suspected faults.

In an interactive system for problem solving, its transparency
concerning capability and limitation is critical for ease of
understanding to facilitate the utility of the system. The capability
of a model-based system largely depends on the characteristics of the
model used in it. Our aim here is explication of capabilities and
limitations of models in model-based diagnostic systems, in particular
limitation of the "depth" of the cause of faults identified by a
diagnostic mechanism using a kind of model. We focus on the process in
which faults are induced and establish an ontology of faults including
several categories of faults. It provides us with a vocabulary for
specifying the scope of a diagnostic activity performed by a reasoning
mechanism using a kind of model. Firstly, the ontology enables us to
specify the performances of the models in diagnostic systems, which
makes the systems transparent to users who want to know what type of
faults the system can diagnose when they describe a target model for a
reasoning mechanism. Next, we develop an interactive system to
enumerate the "deeper causes" of a malfunction. The ontology enables
the human users to control the diagnostic system in a plausible-first
way by relaxing diagnostic assumptions interactively

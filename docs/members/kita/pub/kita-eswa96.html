Model-based expert systems are expected to contribute to overcoming
difficulties of conventional rule-based systems. This paper describes
modeling of mechanical systems and a method of qualitative reasoning
based on causal specifications. The causal specifications represent a
component's local causal properties, following the principles for
reusability and composability. It contributes to providing intuitive
causal ordering of complex behavior originated in the combination of
components, including inter-components' negative feedback. A model of
a system is represented by combining a set of local component models
and global knowledge derived from general properties of the physical
entity. This allows for reusable knowledge which is easy to describe.
Furthermore, the method has been successfully applied to a nuclear
power plant. Reasoning results were unambiguous and matched those
obtained by domain experts.

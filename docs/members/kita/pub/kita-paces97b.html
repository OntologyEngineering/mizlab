<B>Abstract:</B>
The causal chains between faults and symptoms include abnormal
phenomena such as breakage and corrosion which cannot be represented
in terms of physical parameters. Most of model-based diagnosis systems
based on physical parametric models cannot cope with such phenomena,
and thus the deeper causes underlying the faults remain untouched.
This article describes a diagnosis method based on the fault event
models, which represent generic abnormal transitions which could
commonly occur in components in terms of conceptual attributes such as
existence and shape. A framework and an example of the reasoning
integrated with the conventional methods are presented. The integrated
reasoning system can uncover the deeper causes underlying the faults
detected by the conventional methods.

This article discusses an ontology of generic functional concepts of
artifacts, called a functional ontology. We discuss the
requirements for the ontology and the characteristics of some existing
functional modeling languages. We present a functional ontology
described by our functional modeling language FBRL in terms
of its mapping primitives between behavior and function. They make the
definitions independent of their implementation.

The functional ontology enables us to realize a functional
understanding system which identifies functional structures of an
artifact from its behavioral and structural model. It plays a crucial
role to specify and limit the functional space. This article also
presents a framework of the functional understanding system and an
example of functional understanding of a power plant.

This paper proposes a new category of functions of artifacts called
meta-function. Although conventional research on functional
representation defines function as some kinds of abstraction of
changes in objects associated with components, a meta-function of a
component represents a role played by a function of the component for
another function of another component without mention of such changes
specific to the target system. The meta-functions explain the types of
collaboration and dependency among functions of components as part of
the design rationale of the target artifacts. This paper defines nine
types of the meta-functions such as ToEnable and ToDrive, which form
part of an ontology of functional concepts. The utility of the
ontology in explanation and redesign is also discussed.

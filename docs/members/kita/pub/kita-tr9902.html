In an interactive system for problem solving, its transparency
concerning capability and limitation is critical for ease of
understanding to facilitate the utility of the system. Our aim here is
explication of capabilities and limitations of diagnostic systems. We
focus on the process in which faults are induced and establish an
ontology of fault including several categories of fault. It provides
us with a vocabulary for specifying the scope of diagnosis. Firstly,
the ontology enables us to specify capability of diagnostic systems
for transparency to users. Next, we design an interactive system to
enumerate the "deeper causes" of a malfunction. The ontology enables
the human users to control the diagnostic process in a plausible-first
way interactively

This research aims at developing a redesign support system for
manufacturing processes. The redesign task requires identifying not
only behavior of each process-unit but also relations among them such
as "to prevent" and "to allow", because they represent justifications
of the existence of each process-unit. In this article, we propose a
framework of redesign including functional understanding task to
identify functional structure of a target artifact before
modification.

This research is concerned with causal understanding and qualitative
reasoning of behavior of physical systems, which are crucial issues of
model-based problem solving.  In this paper, a new method of
qualitative reasoning and causal ordering is proposed and its
application to a power plant is presented. The method is based on our
kernel ontologies of causality and time-resolution and a domain
ontology of fluid systems. These ontologies help make the design
rationales of our method explicit and facilitate reusability of our
models.  The whole of the target system is represented by combining a
set of local component models and global constraints. The component
models include local and causal characteristics of each component
which are independent of context for their reuse on the basis of the
ontology of causality. Global constraints with time-scales are derived
according to the general properties of the physical entity which are
prepared beforehand as a part of the domain ontology. They contribute
to providing intuitive causal ordering of complex behavior originated
in various configurations of components, including inter-components'
negative feedback. Furthermore, the method has been successfully
applied to a power plant. All the reasoning results matched
those obtained by a domain expert including their ambiguities.

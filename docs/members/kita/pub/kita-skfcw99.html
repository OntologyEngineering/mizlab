This research aims at developing a redesign problem solver which proposes 
suitable modifications of a given artifact for a new requirement or an 
inconvenience. We concentrate on the two issues, capturing design rationales 
of the given artifact and organizing general redesign strategies. For the 
former issue, we propose an ontology of functional concepts, which enables 
the redesign system to identify functional structures representing a part of 
design rationales automatically. It particularly includes a new category of 
functional concepts called meta-functions for representation of dependency 
among functions of components. For the latter issue, we describe an ontology 
of the redesign strategies. Some general strategies for proposing redesign 
solutions in terms of the concepts in the ontology are shown. It reveals 
conceptualization behind the redesign strategies and then helps us specialize 
the Soar architecture into a universal redesign engine.

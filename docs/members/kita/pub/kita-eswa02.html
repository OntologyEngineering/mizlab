<p><b>Abstract</b>. In conceptual design of engineering devices, a designer decomposes 
  a required function into sub-functions, so-called functional decomposition, 
  using a kind of functional knowledge representing achievement relations among 
  functions. However, such knowledge about functionality of engineering devices 
  is usually left implicit because each designer possesses it. Even if such knowledge 
  is found in documents, it is often scattered around technical domains and lacks 
  consistency. Aiming at capturing such functional knowledge explicitly and sharing 
  it in design teams, we discuss its systematic description based on functional 
  ontologies which provide common concepts for its consistent and generic description. 
  We propose a new concept named &quot;way of achievement&quot; as a key concept 
  for capturing such functional knowledge. Categorization of typical representations 
  of the knowledge and its organization as is-a hierarchies are also discussed. 
  The generic concepts representing functionality of a device in the functional 
  knowledge are provided by the functional concept ontology, which makes the functional 
  knowledge consistent and applicable to other domains. We also discuss development 
  of a design supporting system using the systematized knowledge, called a functional 
  way server. It helps human designers redesign an existing engineering device 
  by providing a wide range of alternative ways of achievement of the required 
  function in a manner suitable for the viewpoint of each designer and then facilitates 
  innovative design. </p>

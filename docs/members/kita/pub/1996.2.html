This paper discusses a domain ontology of fluid systems for model-based
reasoning based on two kernel ontologies of time resolution and
causality of components, aiming at explicit description of design rationales of
model-based reasoning systems for knowledge reuse.  Our ontology
design has been done according to the following two criteria:
intuitive causal ordering in terms of components and reusability of
component models. We discuss firstly units of time resolution
necessary for reasoning systems to causal ordering of complex behavior
originated in various configurations of components and discuss
necessary contents of domain ontologies for the time resolution. Next,
a kernel ontology of causality is presented which contributes to
capture context-independent causal properties of components and to
derive appropriate causal relations. On the basis of these kernel
ontologies, causal properties of fluid-related components in fluid
systems and general properties of fluid and heat for deriving global
constraints have been identified. A method of qualitative reasoning
and causal ordering based on the ontologies is discussed together with
its capability.  The ontologies have been successfully applied to a
nuclear power plant modeling and its qualitative simulation. Reasoning
results matched those obtained by a domain expert.

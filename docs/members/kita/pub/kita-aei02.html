<p><b>Abstract</b>. Functionality of artifacts as well as structure and behavior 
  plays crucial roles in problem-solving such as design. This article discusses 
  automatic identifications of functional structures of artifacts from given behavioral 
  models of components and their connection information (called functional understanding). 
  We propose a functional concept ontology which provides a rich vocabulary representing 
  functions together with clear definitions grounded on behavior. The ontology 
  enables the automatic identification system to make the search in the functional 
  space tractable and to screen out meaningless interpretations. Furthermore, 
  the ontology includes a new category of functional concepts named meta-functions 
  representing conceptual categories of interdependency between functions. It 
  plays a crucial role in consolidation of functions to give criteria of grouping 
  functions, that is, identity of consolidated functions. It enables the identification 
  system to generate such functional hierarchies that do not correspond to physical 
  structure.</p>

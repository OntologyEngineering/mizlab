This paper describes a diagnostic method based on the ontology of
faults discussed in <A HREF="kita-jsai98a.html">[Kitamura and Mizoguchi 
1998a]</A>. The ontology defines the concept of the fault event for
capturing faults. On the basis of the concept, we propose a diagnostic
method using the fault event models, which represent generic state
transitions which could commonly occur in components. The
categorization of causes of faults in the ontology helps the modelers
describe such generic models. The reasoning method exhaustively
generates fault hypotheses in wider range. We also integrate the
reasoning method with the conventional methods. Moreover, the set of
classes of faults in the ontology allows users to control the scope of
suspected faults.

This paper proposes a framework of functional understanding for
redesign problem solving, which identifies conceptual functional
structures of an artifact from its behavioral model.  We argue that
a functional ontology plays a crucial role in functional
understanding.  Our functional modeling language FBRL
enables us to build such an ontology in terms of its mapping
primitives between behavior and function called FT.  The ontology
provides a basis of functional reasoning at the comprehensible
conceptual level.  It enables the functional understanding system to
bridge a gap between physical behavioral level and the conceptual
functional level using FTs (called behavior-function mapping) and then
to generate functional hierarchies at the conceptual level (functional
hierarchy understanding).  An example of functional understanding of a
power plant is demonstrated.

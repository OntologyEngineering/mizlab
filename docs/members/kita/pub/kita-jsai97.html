This research is concerned with causal understanding and qualitative
reasoning of behavior of physical systems, which are crucial issues of
model-based problem solving.  In this paper, we describe a domain
ontology of fluid systems and an ontology of time for
generating causal ordering in terms of components.  Our ontology
design has been done according to the following three criteria:
cognitive causal explanations in terms of components, reusability of
components and disambiguation of reasoning results.  We discuss
in-depth requirements for domain ontologies and propose a causal
specification scheme to represent component's local causal properties
and an ontology of time to enable intuitive causal ordering of complex
behavior originated in the combination of components.  We identify
causality of fluid systems following the requirements and
describe reusable models of crucial components of plants and general
properties of fluid and heat for deriving global knowledge.  A method of
qualitative reasoning and causal ordering is discussed together with
its capability and mechanism.  The ontologies have been successfully
applied to nuclear power plant modeling and its qualitative
simulation. Reasoning results matched those obtained by domain
experts.

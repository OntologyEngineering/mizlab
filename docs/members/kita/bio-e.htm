<p>Yoshinobu Kitamura is an associate professor, the Institute of Scientific and 
  Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka Japan. He received his Bachelor, 
  Master and Doctoral degrees of Engineering in 1991, 1993 and 2000 from Osaka 
  University, respectively. He has worked in the same institute as a technical 
  official (1993-1994), a research associate (1994-2003) and then an associate 
  professor (2003-present). He had done visiting research as a senior research 
  fellow at Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands (2002) and 
  as an visiting associate professor at Stanford University, CA, U.S.A. (2007-2008).</P>
<p><br>
  His research interest includes ontology-based modeling of artifacts, engineering 
  knowledge management, and conceptual design support. He has been active in the 
  engineering knowledge research field since 1995, developing a strongly interdisciplinary 
  approach that combines together Ontological Engineering in Artificial Intelligence 
  in Computer Science and Engineering Design (in addition, Philosophy recently). 
  He has published 31 journal papers and 53 papers in international conferences/workshops 
  (reviewed). He has regularly presented papers and talks in the major conferences 
  in the Engineering Design field such as ICED and ASME/IDETC and the Ontological 
  Engineering field.</P>
<p>His best-successful result is an ontology-based modeling framework of functionality 
  of artifact. The functional ontologies for representing functions have been 
  established and knowledge management systems based on the ontologies have been 
  developed. One of those systems has been successfully deployed in industry and 
  engineers have gotten many practical benefits including efficient design review, 
  speed-up of patent writing, solving difficult manufacturing problems and good 
  redesign by describing functional knowledge based on the ontological framework 
  and by sharing it. </P>
<p>He has served as an associate editor of the ASME Transactions - Journal of 
  Computing and Information Science in Engineering (JCISE) and members of the 
  Editorial Board of Advanced Engineering Informatics and that of the Journal 
  and transaction of the Japanese Society of Artificial Intelligence and as reviewers 
  for many major international journals and international conferences in both 
  engineering informatics and computer science fields. <br>

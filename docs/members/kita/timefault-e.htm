<P>A model of an artifact for a model-based problem solving
represents constituents of the target system and principles governing
them. The modelers essentially make some assumptions in order to
restrict and simplify the models. However, in the conventional
model-based problem solving systems, such assumptions are rarely
explicit. As a consequence of such implicitness, when one wants to
reuse a model, it is difficult to know the model is appropriate for
his/her purpose. Ontology plays a crucial role in clarify the
assumptions behind the models and the problem solving systems.</P>

<P>The current research aim is to reveal the assumptions about
"causality" and "time interval" in the qualitative reasoning (QR)
systems. Firstly, we propose "a causal time ontology" to represent
conceptual meanings of time intervals (called "causal time scale")
among causal relations generated by the QR systems. The ontology aims
to enumerate all possible temporal meanings of the models, and to
clarify the temporal performance of the QR systems with respect to
causal ordering, called "causal time resolutions". In the paper, the
performances of some conventional QR systems (e.g., QSIM) are clearly
specified using the concepts in the ontology. (see <A HREF="/pub/kita/kita-ijcai97.html">the
paper</A> in IJCAI-97).</P>

<P>Moreover, we identified 7 causal time scales for fluid-related
systems such as power plants. On the basis of them, we built a domain
ontology of the fluid-related systems which provides reusable models
of crucial components in the systems. Our qualitative reasoning
system can derive more finer-grained causal relations from the
reusable component models than the conventional QR systems (see
<A HREF="/pub/kita/kita-pricai96.html">the paper</A> in
PRICAI'96)</P>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME=fault></A>Categories of faults in diagnostic 
  systems </FONT></H2>

<P>As mentioned <A HREF="#modeling">above</A>, model-based problem
solving systems have own assumptions and limitations. In the case of
diagnostic problems, each model-based diagnostic system detects a
limited scope of possible faults. For example, GDE assumes that the
topology of connections among components is not changed by the
faults.</P>

<P>The goal of this research is to establish an ontology of faults,
aiming at clarifying the scope of detectable faults of the diagnostic
systems. The ontology defines several concepts such as "cause of
faults". We believe there are two meanings of causes of faults, that
is, the cognitive causes and the physical causes. The former specify
locations of faults (i.e., component name) as results of cognitive
interpretation based on hierarchical functional architecture. The
later represent the states that physically cause the symptoms
together with physical causal chains among them. We also define a set
of classes of faults from the viewpoints of physical causes.</P>

<P>The fault ontology provides us the vocabulary for the
followings;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>To specify the limited scope of detectable faults of the
   diagnostic systems (such as GDE).</LI>
   
   <LI>To propose such a diagnostic method that exhaustively
   generates fault hypotheses in wider range.</LI>
   
   <LI>The set of classes of faults in the ontology allows users to
   control the scope of suspected faults.</LI>

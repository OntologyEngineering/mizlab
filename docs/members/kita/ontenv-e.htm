<P>The goal of this research is to develop a computer environment
supporting building and using of ontologies. We consider that the
process of building of an ontology consists of the following five
steps;</P>

<OL>
   <LI>To clarify the scope and the objectives of the ontology</LI>
   
   <LI>To get the knowledge sources (documents)</LI>
   
   <LI>To analyze and organize the knowledge</LI>
   
   <LI>To describe an ontology</LI>
   
   <LI>To evaluate the ontology</LI>
</OL>

<P>The current research aims include to develop the following two
subsystems;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>A guide system supporting the 3rd step</LI>
   
   <LI>An editor system for ontologies for the 4th step.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The former is mainly designed to support the building of domain
ontologies initially from the documents. This system is based on the
ontology building methodology called AFM (Activity-First Method)
where task analysis helps the ontology authors to limit and simplify
the domain concepts.</P>

<P>The later system enables us to browse and edit the ontologies in
the ontology server through the network using the web browsers.</P>

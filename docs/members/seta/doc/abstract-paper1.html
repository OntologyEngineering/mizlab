<B>Abstract:</B><br>
We have investigated the property of problem solving knowledge and
tried to design its ontology, that is, Task ontology. The main purpose
of this paper is to illustrate a Conceptual LEvel Programming
Environment (named CLEPE) as an implemented system based on Task ontology.
CLEPE provides three major advantages as follows. (A) It provides
human-friendly primitives in terms of which users can easily describe
their own problem solving process (descriptiveness, readability). (B)
The systems with task ontology can simulate the problem solving
process at an abstract level in terms of conceptual level primitives
(conceptual level operationality). (C) It provides ontology author
with an environment for building task ontology so that he/she can
build a consistent and useful ontology.
In this paper, firstly we briefly introduce the concept of task
ontology. Secondly, CLEPE and its design principle is described. In
CLEPE, one can represent his/her own problem solving knowledge and
realize the conceptual-level execution.

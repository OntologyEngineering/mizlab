<P>To realize a human friendly conceptual level programming environment,
it is very important to build a static user model based on the analysis,
that is, what concept are most important for end-users when performing
the task and which concepts of problem solving specification could be out
of his/her consciousness. We have investigated a task ontology for building
the static user model. By putting task ontology on the basis of Conceptual
LEvel Programming Environment, CLEPE, it provides three major advantages
as follows. (A) It provides human-friendly primitives in terms of which
users can easily describe their own problem solving process (descriptiveness,
readability). (B) The systems with task ontology can simulate the problem
solving process at an abstract level in terms of conceptual level primitives
(conceptual level operationality). (C) It provides ontology author with
an environment for building task ontology so that he/she can build a consistent
and useful ontology. In this paper, firstly we briefly introduce the concept
of task ontology. Secondly, CLEPE and its design principle is described.
In CLEPE, one can represent his/her own problem solving knowledge and realize
the conceptual-level execution.</P>
